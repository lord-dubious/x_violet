## Log

[2025-04-25T11:03:03-04:00] - Initialized project structure, planning docs, and collaboration files (`updates.md`, `agent_briefing.md`). Scaffolded Python module files and placeholder directories. - [Cascade]
[2025-04-25T11:14:00Z] - Implemented `xviolet/persona.py` with `Persona` class for loading `holly.json` and generating LLM context. Added basic `if __name__ == "__main__"` test. Fixed initial syntax errors. - [Cascade]
[2025-04-25T11:16:00Z] - Implemented `xviolet/provider/proxy.py` with `ProxyManager` class for handling `SOCKS5_PROXY` env var. Added basic `if __name__ == "__main__"` test using placeholder in `.env`. Fixed `httpx` test block syntax. - [Cascade]

## Delegations

**To Augment:**
- [ ] Review `ai_instruct/agent_briefing.md` for project context and collaboration protocol.
- [ ] Research and implement the SOCKS5 proxy logic in `xviolet/provider/proxy.py` and `xviolet/provider/proxy_status.py`, based on `proxystr` and `twkit_ext` examples. Ensure it supports rotating IPs and displays status/refresh prompts on startup. All requests must strictly use this proxy. Log your progress and findings in this file under the 'Log' section.
- [ ] Research and implement the Twitter authentication logic (porting from `client-twitter` JS/TS to Python) in `xviolet/client/twitter_auth.py`. Ensure cookies are saved to `xviolet/client/cookies.json` and all auth requests use the proxy. Log your progress and findings here.

**To Cascade:**
- [ ] Implement Gemini LLM integration (`xviolet/provider/llm.py`).
- [ ] Implement Twitter API client (`xviolet/client/twitter_api.py`) using `twikit`.
- [ ] Implement Media handling (`xviolet/media.py`).
- [ ] Implement main agent loop (`xviolet/main.py`).
- [ ] Implement tests.
